# Project-1-About-Muhammad
We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned in the past 1 month on HTML and CSS.
I took the opportunity to create an on-line resume that will showcase my current and new skills to my potential employers. 
I decided to built an online-resume because It is something that I feel that I can build on after the course and further demonstrate my technical abilities as a programmer.
I decided to go for a simple, fresh and easy to navigate webpage so that the user can easily find out facts about myself, my work experience
and favourite websites. I chose a blue theme because blue is my favourite color.
Working on this website allows me to improve my knowledge on using HTML and CSS code aided with bootstrap.
Specifically this project allows me to deepend my knowledge on
1) Using boostrap to make responsive websites with the help of 'container'
2) Using bootstrap to make navigation links with hanburger toggler button when screen resizes
3) Attaching images
4) Attaching card type links
5) Positioning of text and images
6) Adjusting CSS styles to suit my website's design
7) RUnning code through validators encourages me to apply correct syntax
8) Applying padding and margin to text and images
9) Using bootstrap grid layout to position text and images
